# GAMEMENU
I developed a game menu using html, javascript and css. It includes three games: RPSLS, Reflex Game, Tic Tac Toe.
This program can be run by using the "Live Server" extension on visual studio code, also by running the mainmenu.html or each game html exclusively. 
Hope you enjoy this program.
